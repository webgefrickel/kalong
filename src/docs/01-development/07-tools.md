title: Recommended Tools & Helpers
---

Those tools are not part of this package, but I really would recommend
that you have a look at them :)

- [npm-check-updates](https://github.com/tjunnone/npm-check-updates) —
  find and save the latest versions of dependencies, regardless of any
  version constraints in your package.json
- [stylestats](https://github.com/t32k/stylestats) — evaluate your
  generated stylesheets for size, number of selectors etc.
- [css-colorguard](https://github.com/SlexAxton/css-colorguard) — checks
  your CSS for too similar colors
- [notes](https://github.com/stephenb/node-notes) — a small tool for
  checking all your code for TODO, FIXME, OPTIMIZE and NOTE comments

TODO: install backstopjs

TODO: evaluate/replace shared.json
https://github.com/plentycode/sass-export

You can install them all via npm, give them a spin!
